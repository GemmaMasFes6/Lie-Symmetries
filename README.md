# Lie-Symmetries
Lie_Symmetry is a MATLAB code that provides a tool for searching symmetries in nonlinear models in order to convert a non-observable model observable (respectively, identifiable). Those models are described by ordinary differential equations and restrict to rational functions, despite of this restriction, there are a wide range of models included in. 

This semi-automatic algorithm can study models with initial conditions (parametric, numeric or a combination of both, they can be known or unknown), input functions (known or unknown) initial conditions. 

# Requirements
Lie_Symmetry requires a MATLAB installation with the Symbolic toolbox. It is only necessary to download the folder that includes two folders and one main programme:
 - FUNCTIONS. This folder includes all the necessary functions to run the programme.
 - MODELS. This folder includes some models as examples.
 - Lie-Symmetry. This file is the main programme where the user can choose the options of the symmetry study.
