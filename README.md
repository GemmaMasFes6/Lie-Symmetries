# Lie-Symmetries
Lie_Symmetry is a MATLAB code that provides a tool for searching symmetries in biological and chemical unobservable or unidentifiable models. The program can only be applied to rational functions however, there are a wide range of models included in this restriction.
With Lie algebra and infinitesimal polynomials, it transforms rational expressions into linear systems and offer a variable change that transforms the unobservable (respectively, unidentifiable) to observable (respectively, identifiable) model. This semi-automatic algorithm can study also models with parametric, numeric or a combination of both, initial conditions. 

The user can choose the degree of the infinitesimal polynomial, its type (univariate, partially variate or multivariate) and the maximum degree of Lie series (when the reparametrization need it).
